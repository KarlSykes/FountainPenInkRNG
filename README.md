# FountainPenInkRNG
Fun little exercise in making a "web app" using P5.js. 
Reads information fountain pen inks from a csv file from which program uses a special way to "randomly" select a colour. Letters are randomly selected one by one, gradually building the colour name, and gradually elimating colours that don't match. This continues until there is only one colour that remains. 
Finally the program displays the colour alongside its name. There are a few animations on the screen. For instance, the remaining words whizz in the background. Additionally, there is a count for how many "failed" attempts". In other words, how many random letters the program produces before it reaches the final colour.
